# Calculator Web App

The **Calculator Web App** is an interactive calculator application built with JavaScript on Code.org. This project was developed as part of my **AP Computer Science Project** during my **sophomore (10th grade) year in Fall 2021**. It provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface for performing various mathematical operations.

## About the Project

The app is designed to make basic and advanced calculations intuitive and engaging. It includes functionality for standard arithmetic operations, square roots, exponents, and percentages, with a responsive output display. The project demonstrates the use of JavaScript to handle user input, manage state, and create a seamless user experience.

### Key Features:
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with an easy-to-use button interface.
   
2. **Advanced Mathematical Functions:**
   - Includes advanced operations such as:
     - Square (`x²`)
     - Square root (`√x`)
     - Exponents (`x^y`)
     - Reciprocal (`1/x`)
     - Percentage (`%`)
     - Negation (`-(x)`)
     - Powers of 10 (`10^x`)
     - Pi (`π`)

3. **Dynamic Output Display:**
   - Displays up to 18 characters for calculations and ensures results are responsive to changes.
   - Automatically truncates long outputs for better readability.

4. **Delete and Reset:**
   - Delete individual characters or operations with a backspace function.
   - Reset the entire calculation with a single button.

5. **Interactive Sound Effects:**
   - Button clicks and actions are paired with sound effects to enhance user engagement.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Prevents invalid input sequences such as multiple decimal points or undefined operations.

## Development Context

This project was developed on **Code.org**, showcasing the application of JavaScript for handling dynamic user interactions. The calculator was designed to provide an educational tool for both learning and demonstrating core programming concepts in AP Computer Science.
